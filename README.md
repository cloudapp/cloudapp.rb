# CloudApp Ruby Client [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cloudapp/cloudapp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/cloudapp/cloudapp)

Interact with the [CloudApp API][] from Ruby. Comes with a command line
interface to CloudApp as an added bonus.

[cloudapp api]: http://developer.getcloudapp.com

## Requirements

`cloudapp` requires Ruby 1.9.2 or greater.


## Usage

_Usage from Ruby is still a work in progress._


## CLI

Experience all the pleasures of sharing with CloudApp now in your terminal. The
goal of `cloudapp` is to be simple and Unix-friendly.

### Quick Start

    gem install cloudapp
    cloudapp list
    cloudapp bookmark http://douglasadams.com
    cloudapp upload ~/Desktop/screenshot.png

### Examples

 - Bookmark a link: `cloudapp bookmark http://getcloudapp.com`
 - Bookmark several links: `cloudapp bookmark http://douglasadams.com http://zombo.com`
 - Share a file: `cloudapp upload screenshot.png`
 - Share several files: `cloudapp upload *.png`
 - List newest drops: `cloudapp list [--count=5]`
 - Copy a new drop's link (OS X): `cloudapp bookmark http://douglasadams.com | pbcopy`
 - Output drops in CSV: `cloudapp --format=csv list`

More examples can be found on [the man page][man-page].

### Wish List

`cloudapp` could be awesome with a little more flare.

 - Download a drop: `cloudapp download http://cl.ly/abc123`
 - Output specific columns: `cloudapp list --columns=name,views,link`
 - Handle bookmarks from STDIN: `pbpaste | cloudapp bookmark`
 - Handle files from STDIN: `find *.png | cloudapp upload`
 - Archive and share several files: `cloudapp upload --archive *.png`
 - Encrypt and share a file: `cloudapp upload --encrypt launch_codes.txt`
 - Download and decrypt and encrypted drop: `cloudapp download --key=def456 http://cl.ly/abc123`

While we're dreaming, what could you do if `cloudapp` had a database of all your
drops? Bonus points for a light weight daemon that kept everything in sync at
all times.

 - Find all your screen shots: `cloudapp list /^screen ?shot.*\.png$/`
 - Trash all your stale drops: `cloudapp delete --last-viewed="> 1 month ago"`
 - See your drop views in real time: `cloudapp --tail`

There's bound to be a better way to express some of these commands, but you get
the picture.

### Harness the Power

Sure you could copy the new drop's link by piping the output to `pbcopy`, but
that's a lot of extra key presses. Instead, try setting this super secret
Cloud.app preference:

    defaults write com.linebreak.CloudAppMacOSX CLUploadShouldCopyExternallyUploadedItems -bool YES

Now after restarting Cloud.app, the link to every new drop shared with your
account--even using a tool other than the Mac app--will be copied to your Mac's
clipboard. If you're using the [stand-alone version][stand-alone] of Cloud.app
and not [the Mac App Store version][mas], use the domain
`com.linebreak.CloudAppMacOSXSparkle` instead.
